# FiveSeconds
Currently incomplete


FiveSeconds is an app I created for my niece to help her with school subjects while giving me a chance to sharpen my development skills. After signing up or logging in, users are taken to a homepage where they can take quizzes and view their scores. These scores and everything else are stored in a PostgreSQL database. Users with an admin role have additional privileges, such as creating or deleting quizzes and managing user accounts.
